    <strong>Other pollutants </strong></p>
  <p align="left">Many chemical pollutants are so new in the  environment, we do not know how dangerous they are. They are tested in a  laboratory but not on an entire marine ecosystem. Metals such as mercury and  slowly degrading chemicals threaten inland and coastal waters. In the USA over  800 contaminants were identified in the waters and sediment of the Great Lakes.  These toxic materials harm wildlife, and in the food chain they contaminate  fish and shellfish that we consume. </p>
  <p align="left">Dioxins are very toxic. They can cause  genetic changes in marine life, and are suspected of causing cancer in human  beings. The industrial compounds known as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) can  cause reproductive problems in some animals, and accumulate as they pass along  the food chain. <br />
    <strong><br />
    </strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Salinity </strong></p>
  <p align="left">Salinity levels on land and in rivers are  increasing, due to the ongoing farming practice of substituting native  vegetation with shallow-rooted crops. Rising groundwater levels bring salt to  the surface and rain washes it into the rivers. The salt affects ground level  vegetation, wetlands and other water bodies. The consequences of salinity are  costly, both economically and ecologically. Farmland, buildings, infrastructure  and habitats are destroyed by salt. <br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Grey water </strong></p>
  <p align="left">Modern societies produce vast amounts of  grey water, i.e. waste water which is not contaminated with toilet water. Some  of this can be recycled in gardens. It should be noted that health departments  are cautious about re-using shower and bath water, which can be contaminated by  body wastes and could lead to infection. Kitchen water often contains grease  and highly toxic detergents that are damaging to the soil. In addition, sewer  systems are often designed to be flushed with grey water. </p>
